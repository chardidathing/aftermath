# Contributing

### New Guides
- If you're submitting a contribution creating new guides, that you believe should be apart of the generalised process, order them as such with the number indicators (e.g: `07_process-here.md`)
- Try and format your guides similarly as I've done, however I'm not writing a style guide so go ham :3
- If your guide is applicable to include a checklist, do so in the checklists folder, with the format of `07_process-here-checklist.md`.

### Adding resources
- For service contributions (Password Managers, etc.), open an issue for this, with your contribution, and I'll review it and see whether I'd consider adding it to the list.
- For localised resource contributions, try and keep it to official government resources.
- For all localised & generalised resource contributions, write a short descriptive title, or use the one from the resource you're adding (e.g: `[ACSC - Threats](https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats)`) 

### Translations
- If the language doesn't already exist, create a branch with the locale in POSIX format (e.g: `en_AU`, `ja_JP`, `zh_CN`)
- When submitting a PR for a new language, note this and I will create a branch and merge your changes into it.
